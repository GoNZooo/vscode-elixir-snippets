# elixir-tm

Graciously borrowed all the snippets from the [TextMate bundle for Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-editors/elixir-tmbundle) and refactored them to work with VS Code.

## Quick setup

To start using this extension with Visual Studio Code:

```sh

git clone https://github.com/florinpatrascu/vscode-elixir-snippets.git
```

And copy the `vscode-elixir-snippets` folder into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder. Restart Code.

**Enjoy!**
